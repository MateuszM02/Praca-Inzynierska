Here is my Engineering thesis on Boost vs STL libraries comparison in C++
The project is split into 2 folders:
1. src is for all methods that are compared using Boost, STL and own implementation,
2. tests is for tests which measure methods execution time on multiple examples.
Each of those folders will have 10 subfolders, with each subfolder defining different method.
Each method will be tested on 3-5 different classes defined in that subfolder.
In the future this repository will also have document describing results of tests done for each method.
